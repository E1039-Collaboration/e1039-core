## A script to set up the environment to build and install the e1039-core
## package.  Usage:
##   /path/to/setup-install.sh /path/to/your_inst_directory
##
## This script first creates an installation directory together with a 
## script "this-core.sh".  It then tries to find proper E1039_RESOURCE and 
## E1039_SHARE directories depending on the host name.  When successful, 
## it creates a script "this-e1039.sh", which sets up all the resource,
## share and core environments at once.
##
## One need not use this script but can set up everything by oneself.  But 
## this script should be helpful in preparing for an easily-reproducible 
## environment.  Any questions/requests can be sent to Kenichi.
